# React Coding Interview (Beginner level)

The project inspired from a video on Ben Awad's channel: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnkrDse9QKc&t=1187s

- This is my practice for revision `React` skills after 1 year of learning the
  framework. I call React is a framework since we can merge React with other
  libraries so that developers can build a fullstack or serverless projects having
  React as a frontend.

- In this project, I don't use `Node.js` for the backend, instead I use `firebase`
  since I want to familiarize the tool.

# Agenda

- A counter having increment and decrement buttons,

- Fetch data from https://randomuser.me/api and display fetched data (JSON) to
  the frontend,

- Fetch and display a random user, including a fetch button,

- Fetch and display multiple random users, including a fetch more button. Use
  grid layout,

- Fetch and display multiple random users, including previous and next buttons.
  Each page contains 3 users,

- Login/Register features. Using `firebase` to store the user information
  (username, email, hashed password),

- Login, Register form popups

- A simple chat application with `socket.io` library,

- Use `json-server` for mocking database

- Build a Recommendation System with Python (actually this task I inspired from
  the video, Vietnamese, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cd0-v4YvLj8). The JSON
  data is taken from `db.json` file which is built by `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE`
  methods and store by `lowdb`.
